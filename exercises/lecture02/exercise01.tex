\begin{Aufgabe}[Exploiting data redundancy for compression]{}
  Which types of redundancy are present in digital audio signals and how are these
  used for the compression of audio files in MP3 format? Please answer
  with a short text of about 200 words.
\end{Aufgabe}

\begin{Aufgabe}[Run Length Encoding and Decoding]{}
  Write a program in Python that reads binary data from a file (see binary-data.txt as
  an example) and encodes that in a run-length representation. What compression
  ratio do you get? Save this to a file with .rle extension.\\
  Write another program that decodes the run-length encoded file written by the
  first program and restores the original data.
\end{Aufgabe}

\begin{Aufgabe}[Discrete Cosine Transform]{}
  Write a program in Python that reads an 8x8 matrix from a file (see matrix.txt as
  an example) and computes a 2D DCT of that matrix.
